This will start with an in-line comment subject to change in the future depending on additional tasks, change in tasks, additional info obtained, connectivity with the database, etc., which will give the reader an overview of how I attempted the task, what was on my mind when doing the task, how I approached it, my logic, why I did somethings over the other, and what was my approach at solving the task.
If you want to jump to the tasks update directly, you can [Jump to Task](#task)
There will be an update on Assumptions taken during the completion of the task which can be found here: [Jump to Assumptions](#assumptions)

## Comments
for one, I started with the spring boot initializer at start.spring.io, and chose the basic dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and MySQL Driver.
wrote a couple of assumptions to go together with why choose gradle over maven, and why i would assume something like that...

## Assumptions

  1. I have chosen to go with the Gradle-Groovy Java project since I am not sure if this will be a typical task of performing CRUD operations on the Employee Dataset, and expose the same externally via APIs.
  2. Here I assume that there will be future tasks entailed to this one, or some additional ammendments required for the type of services that are being created, hence I have chosen to use Gradle over Maven.
  3. Since it will be easier to change at a later stage.

This is an important assumption because if I am toassume that whatever I am tasked to do is a one off and no more changes would be required moving forward, and that the task is completely defined, I would choose to use Maven for structure.
